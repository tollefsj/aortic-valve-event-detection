*Table. C.1 The table shows the sensitivity of different hyper parameters. The results are calculated by averaging both the species: canines and porcines, and both the events: AVO and AVC. The values are given as $\pi$ $\pm$ $\Delta$ $\mu$, where $\mu$ is the mean and $\Delta \mu$ the uncertainty of the mean from 50 nested cross-validation runs with different seeds. BN: Batch normalization, GN: Group normalization, lr: Learning rate, MBP: Max Blur Pool, *: Linear activation (no sigmoid). The definition of the average error is given in Equation [8]*
